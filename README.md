## What Is Beholden?

Beholden is a fast, self-hosted campaign tracker for tabletop RPGs. It has two distinct interfaces that share a single backend:

- **DM App** (`web-dm`) - for Dungeon Masters to manage campaigns, encounters, combat, NPCs, treasure, notes, and the compendium
- **Player App** (`web-player`) - for players to manage their characters, view shared campaign info, and follow along in real time

Everything runs on a single Node.js server with a local SQLite database. No cloud account required.

---

## Features

**DM App**
- Campaign, adventure, and encounter management
- Live combat tracker with initiative, HP, conditions, spell slots, and legendary actions
- Player roster with HP, AC, conditions, and death saves
- INPCs (in-party NPCs) with full stat tracking
- Native JSON monster, item, spell, and rules compendium
- Treasure and notes per campaign and adventure
- Real-time sync across all connected clients via WebSocket
- Saved panel layouts for Campaign, Combat Roster, Combat, and the Binder dashboard
- Move panels between 1–4 columns and customize their accent, background, and text colours through **Layout & colours**. Duplicate layouts for different tasks, preview changes, then save or cancel. Preferences are saved per account; resetting a layout restores its original arrangement and colours.

**Player App**
- Character creation and management
- Character sheet with stats, HP, AC, speed, and abilities
- Campaign dashboard showing your assigned campaigns
- Real-time updates from the DM

**Auth & Multi-user**
- JWT-based login with per-user accounts
- Role-based access: Admin, DM, Player
- Admins manage users and campaign memberships
- Players are redirected to the player app automatically; DMs access the full DM interface
- During active combat, players can open an Engaged Enemies drawer showing damaged hostile combatants as Damaged, Bloodied, or Down without exposing exact HP.

```

The Player character sheet lives in `web-player/src/views/character/`.
Its entry view and composition files stay at that level; related implementation
files are grouped in `combat/`, `creatures/`, `inventory/`, `layout/`, `notes/`,
`spells/`, and `state/`. Unit tests stay beside the code they cover. Tests spanning
multiple features belong in the app's `src/tests/integration/` folder.

Reference documents: [AI content guide](docs/guides/ai-content.md) and
[Binder implementation plan](docs/plans/binder-implementation.md).

Workspace manifests, tool configuration, local environment configuration, and
Windows launchers remain at their expected root locations. Runtime data and
compendium source files are separate from application source.

## Getting Started (Local)

### 1. Install

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cbgfx/beholden.git
cd beholden
npm install
```

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env` file in the repo root:

```env
BEHOLDEN_SUPPORT=true
BEHOLDEN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
BEHOLDEN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5000
WEB_PORT=5173
SERVER_PORT=5174
```

### 3. Dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

- DM app: `http://localhost:5173`
- Player app: `http://localhost:5175`
- API: `http://localhost:5174`

### 4. Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The server serves both apps and the API from a single port (default `5174`):

- DM app: `http://localhost:5174/`
- Player app: `http://localhost:5174/player/`
- API: `http://localhost:5174/api/`

Both app footers display the running server version. Beholden checks the version on the
repository's `main` branch once per day. When a newer version is available, an
administrator can select **Update Available** to launch `update-beholden.bat`, which performs
a fast-forward-only pull, installs dependencies, and rebuilds the applications. Restart the
running server after the batch file finishes. Local tracked changes that conflict with an
update are left untouched and cause the pull to stop instead of being overwritten.

### 5. First login

On first run a default admin account is created:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

Change the password immediately via Admin -> Users, or set `BEHOLDEN_ADMIN_USER` / `BEHOLDEN_ADMIN_PASS` in `.env` before the first run.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5174` | Server port (Railway injects this automatically) |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `5174` | Dev-mode server port |
| `WEB_PORT` | `5173` | Dev-mode DM app port |
| `WEB_PLAYER_PORT` | `5175` | Dev-mode player app port |
| `BEHOLDEN_DATA_DIR` | Platform default | Directory for the SQLite database and uploaded images |
| `BEHOLDEN_DB_PATH` | `<data_dir>/beholden.db` | Override the database file path |
| `BEHOLDEN_ADMIN_USER` | `admin` | Initial admin username (used only on first run) |
| `BEHOLDEN_ADMIN_PASS` | `admin` | Initial admin password (used only on first run) |
| `BEHOLDEN_JWT_SECRET` | Generated per installation | Optional private JWT signing secret. Without it, a durable key is stored as `jwt-secret` in the data directory. Empty values and the old public default are rejected. |
| `BEHOLDEN_SUPPORT` | `false` | Show a support link in the UI |
| `BEHOLDEN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `900000` | Rate limit window in ms |
| `BEHOLDEN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `5000` | Max requests per window |
| `BEHOLDEN_LOG_EGRESS` | `-` | Set to `true` to log large per-request wire egress after compression |
| `BEHOLDEN_LOG_EGRESS_MIN_BYTES` | `1048576` | Minimum compressed response bytes logged when egress logging is enabled; use `0` temporarily to log every response |
| `BEHOLDEN_DEBUG` | - | Set to `true` for verbose server logs |

---

## Deployment (Railway)

Beholden is designed to deploy to [Railway](https://railway.app) as three services from the same repo:

| Service | Start command | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| `server` | `npm start` | `api.yourapp.com` |
| `web-dm` | `npm -w web-dm start` | `dm.yourapp.com` |
| `web-player` | `npm -w web-player start` | `player.yourapp.com` |

Set `BEHOLDEN_DATA_DIR=/data` and mount a Railway volume at `/data` to persist the database across deploys.

Set `VITE_API_ORIGIN` on both web services to point at your server's public URL (e.g. `https://api.yourapp.com`) so the frontend knows where to connect.

## Compendium

Beholden Grand Schema JSON is the strict, portable native format. Editable exports contain one independently manageable category:

- monsters, items, spells, classes, species, backgrounds, and feats;
- deck cards;
- bastion spaces, orders, and facilities.

From **Compendium -> Admin**, export any loaded category to a Grand Schema JSON file, export all ten categories as one ZIP, or import a single-category document or flat multi-category document. Matching IDs are always replaced.

Legacy XML and conversion-oriented source shapes are not product inputs. Grand Schema entries use explicit structured fields, reject legacy-shaped fields, and never depend on parsing descriptive prose to discover mechanics.

Adventure version 2 files can embed native compendium batches. Their entries are installed before the adventure, allowing a portable adventure to bring its own monsters, items, spells, and other rules content. The compendium is shared across all campaigns.

## License

MIT - free to use, modify, and self-host.

Campaign JSON exports (version 2) include story, private notes, party currency, and portable stash items and require DM/admin access. Replacing a campaign preserves its local memberships; importing into a different installation does not grant memberships from the file. Legacy documents preserve existing narrative/currency fields they omit.

The authentication update requires signing in again. Password resets/changes and administrator role changes invalidate existing sessions. Keep the generated `jwt-secret` private and persistent alongside the data directory; installations sharing a database must share their signing configuration.
